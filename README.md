# JO: Opinionated Go library to build RESTful JSON APIs.

Jo wraps around [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) library and implements common patterns
useful in creating JSON APIs, such as strict response structure, authorization, logging.
Basically I've extracted here all the stuff I usually add building APIs. It wouldn't fit
everyone but that's exactly the point: to agree on common things and let developers
focus on specific implementation. If you need more flexibilityâ€“go get [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin).
